# py-Chat

A **very WIP** messaging/chatroom application, and extension of a college project.

## Set-up

Run the following in the root directory:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt` to set up dependencies
- `python db_create.py` or equivalent to set-up the database (only once)
- `python run.py` or equivalent to get the application running on localhost:5000

## Features

- Register an account
- Login to an account
- Send and accept friend requests
- Talk to friends
- Create and join groups to chat in

## Current issues

- Chats do not auto-refresh
- Hideous UI
